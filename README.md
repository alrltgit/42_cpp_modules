# 42 C++ Modules

This repository contains my solutions for the **42 School C++ Piscine / Modules (CPP00–CPP09)**.  
The goal of these modules is to learn **Object-Oriented Programming in C++**, memory management, and core C++ concepts following the **C++98 standard**.

- **CPP00** – Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, access specifiers.
