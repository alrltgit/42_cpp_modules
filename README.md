# 42 C++ Modules

This repository contains my solutions for the **42 School C++ Modules**.  
The goal of these modules is to learn **Object-Oriented Programming in C++**, memory management, and core C++ concepts following the **C++98 standard**.

- **CPP00** – Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, access specifiers.

- **CPP01** - Memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statements.

- **CPP02** - Inheritance.

## ⚙️ Compilation

```bash
make
